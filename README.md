# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Brief

Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm **Anthony I. Jackson** a 16 years old game and software developer that has been doing it as a hobby for ~5 years now.

## What do I do?

I currently do have a job, working at the Coded By Kids organization but after the summer ends I'll be out of a job. Quite unfortunate.

For hobbies I spent most of my time programming since it is my favorite thing to do.

If you count game development as a hobby thats one of the things I do on my spare time but along with that I also take time creating music in Music Trackers for retro computers and video game consoles.

**Hobbies**
* Game/Software Development
* Music Composition/Arranging

## Where are you planing to go?

For the most part I haven't really thought that far about my future as I think of it as something that future me will have to worry about and to be honest I'm trying to have fun while I can before paying taxes and bills becomes the thing I do for the rest of my life.

If you want a general idea, you would probably imagine my career choice being in IT.

Most likely in Web Development or continued Software Development since I'm a very big of *low-level computing*.

## What's going on in your life?

W.I.P
