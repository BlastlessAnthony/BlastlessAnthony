# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Brief

Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm **Anthony I. Jackson** a 16 years old game and software developer that has been doing it as a hobby for ~5 years now.

## What do I do?

I currently do have a job, working at the Coded By Kids organization but after the summer ends I'll be out of a job. Quite unfortunate.

For hobbies I spent most of my time programming since it is my favorite thing to do.

If you count game development as a hobby thats one of the things I do on my spare time but along with that I also take time creating music in Music Trackers for retro computers and video game consoles.

**Hobbies**
* Game/Software Development
* Music Composition/Arranging

## Where are you planing to go?

For the most part I haven't really thought that far about my future as I think of it as something that future me will have to worry about and to be honest I'm trying to have fun while I can before paying taxes and bills becomes the thing I do for the rest of my life.

If you want a general idea, you would probably imagine my career choice being in IT.

Most likely in Web Development or continued Software Development since I'm a very big of *low-level computing*.

## What's going on in your life?
Currently I'm at a point in my life where I have no idea where to actually go and I'm just going with the flow
of life and hoping nothing bad happens. Dumb idea but it has been working up to this point so who knows.

I'm a student going into my Junior year of High School and I'm planned to graduate from High School in 2025 which is nice.
